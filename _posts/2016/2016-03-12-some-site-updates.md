At some point in this blog's history, I had merged it in with my technical writing blog. I did this to try to consolidate and simplify the management of the site. However, I have now separated it back out into its own site because I think it will allow me to write more freely and not worry about the wrong audience trying to make sense of the posts.

Also, to simplify photo embedding, rather than trying to embed photos into each of the posts, I'm going to mainly embed the photos from Flickr or Instagram, because it's simply easier to do it that way. 

This site is also now powered by Github Pages and Jekyll rather than WordPress, so underneath the code is entirely different. I'm using a theme called The Long Haul.
